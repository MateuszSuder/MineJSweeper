# MineJSweeper
Minesweeper using JS, TS, jQuery, CSS.

## How can I see it?
Live version is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://mateuszsuder.github.io/MineJSweeper/)

## But why?
I wanted to test my skills in JS/TS ES6+ and DOM manipulation and also always wanted to create my own Minesweeper

## Can I run this locally?
Yes! Just simply [download package](https://github.com/MateuszSuder/MineJSweeper/archive/master.zip) unzip and run index.html!
